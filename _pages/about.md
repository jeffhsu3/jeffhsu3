###Genetic Control of Gene Expression
<img src='/images/genecontrol.jpg'><br />
Genome-wide association studies have identified 23 loci for atrial fibrillation
(AF), but the mechanisms responsible for these associations, as well as the
causal genes and genetic variants, remain undefined.  To identify the effect of
common genetic variants on gene expression that might explain the mechanisms
linking genome-wide association loci with AF risk, we performed RNA sequencing
of left atrial appendages from a biracial cohort of 265 subjects.
