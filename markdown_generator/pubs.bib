        abstract = {Rationale Atrial fibrillation (AF) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified significant associations for rs1152591 and linked variants in the SYNE2 gene encoding the nesprin-2 protein that connects the nuclear membrane with the cytoskeletonObjective Determine the effects of the AF-associated rs1152591 and rs1152595, two linked intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), on SYNE2 expression and investigate the mechanisms for their association with AF.Methods and Results RNA sequencing of human left atrial appendage (LAA) tissues indicated that rs1152591 and rs1152595 were significantly associated with the expressions of SYNE2α1, a short mRNA isoform, without an effect on the expression of the full-length SYNE2 mRNA. SYNE2α1 mRNA uses an alternative transcription start site and encodes an N-terminal deleted 62 kDa nesprin-2α1 isoform, which can act as a dominant-negative on nuclear-cytoskeleton connectivity. Western blot and qPCR assays confirmed that AF risk alleles of both SNPs were associated with lower expression of nesprin-2α1 in human LAA tissues. Reporter gene transfections demonstrated that the risk vs. reference alleles of rs1152591 and rs1152595 had decreased enhancer activity. SYNE2 siRNA knockdown (KD) or nesprin-2α1 overexpression studies in human stem cell-derived induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) resulted in ~12.5 \% increases in the nuclear area compared to controls (p\&lt;0.001). Atomic force microscopy demonstrated that SYNE2 KD or nesprin-2α1 overexpression led to 57.5\% or 33.2\% decreases, respectively, in nuclear stiffness compared to controls (p\&lt; 0.0001).Conclusions AF-associated SNPs rs1152591 and rs1152595 downregulate the expression of SYNE2α1, increasing nuclear-cytoskeletal connectivity and nuclear stiffness.

        abstract = {Rationale Our prior RNA sequencing study found that FAM13B gene expression in human left atrial appendages was strongly associated with an atrial fibrillation (AF) susceptibility-associated variant on chr. 5q31.Objective To identify the common genetic variant responsible for regulating FAM13B expression and the effect of FAM13B expression on cardiomyocyte gene expression in order to gain insight into the functional mechanism of the chr. 5q31 AF susceptibility locus.Methods and Results By taking advantage of a smaller linkage disequilibrium block in African descent subjects and available chromatin conformation data, we identified the common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17171731 as a candidate genetic variant controlling FAM13B gene expression in the left atrium. Functional analysis demonstrated that the AF risk allele of rs17171731 had less enhancer activity than the protective allele. Gel mobility shift studies determined that the risk allele bound to an additional protein that may function as a transcriptional repressor. Knockdown of FAM13B expression in stem cell-derived human cardiomyocytes (iCM) altered the expression of \&gt;1000 genes and modified the sodium current, consistent with increased susceptibility to atrial fibrillation. Transfection of GFP tagged FAM13B into iCMs demonstrated expression on the plasma membrane and at the Z-disk.Conclusions The chr. 5q31 AF risk variant was identified as rs17171731, with the risk allele having less enhancer activity, leading to decreased expression of FAM13B, which resides on the plasma membrane and the Z-disk, and appears to play a role in the regulation of cardiomyocyte gene expression and the late sodium current.},
